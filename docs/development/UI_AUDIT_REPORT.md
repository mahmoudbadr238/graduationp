- ✅ Consistent dark theme across all 7 pages
- ✅ Zero text overlap issues
- ✅ Excellent readability with proper contrast
- ✅ Uniform card styling and layout
- ✅ Proper scrolling behavior
- ✅ Responsive design at all breakpoints
- ✅ Smooth navigation between pages

---

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Card.qml Content Container Overlap** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Dual aliases (`content` and `children`) both pointed to `contentContainer.data`, causing Item container to overlap with card title Text.

**Fix:** 
- Removed duplicate `content` alias
- Changed `contentContainer` from `Item` to `ColumnLayout` with proper spacing
- Children now properly layout vertically without overlap

**Impact:** Eliminates all potential layout conflicts in cards across all pages.

---

### 2. **AppSurface ScrollView Width Binding** ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** ScrollView child used `width: parent.width` which doesn't account for scrollbar width, causing horizontal scrolling issues.

**Fix:**
- Changed to `width: parent.parent.availableWidth` 
- Added `contentWidth: availableWidth` on ScrollView
- Now properly respects scrollbar presence

**Impact:** Smooth vertical scrolling without unwanted horizontal scroll.

## QML Warnings Status

### Before Audit:
- ⚠️ 3 layout anchor warnings in EventViewer.qml
- ⚠️ Button customization warnings (non-critical, Windows native style)

### After Audit:
- ✅ **Zero layout warnings** - All anchor issues resolved
- ⚠️ Button warnings remain (expected, Windows style limitation - non-blocking)

**Note:** Button customization warnings are expected on Windows native style and do not affect functionality or appearance. They can be eliminated by switching to Material/Basic style in `main.py` if desired.

## Recommendations for Future Enhancement

1. **Performance:** Consider virtualizing long ListViews (>100 items)
2. **Accessibility:** Add keyboard navigation to scan mode cards
3. **Theming:** Consider adding light theme variant (currently dark only)
4. **Data Binding:** Connect to actual backend data models
5. **Localization:** Add i18n support for multi-language
