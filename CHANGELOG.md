### ✨ Major Improvements

**Theme System**
- Implemented singleton Theme pattern via `qmldir` module system

- Fixed all component imports to use module imports (`import "../components"`) instead of direct file paths
- Removed circular/incorrect import dependencies
- Fixed QtQuick.Effects import syntax (removed version numbers for Qt 6.9 compatibility)
- Updated all components to use correct Theme property access patterns

**Page Files - Complete Rewrites**
- `EventViewer.qml`: Event monitoring with ListView, status indicators, AlertTriangle integration

- **Lines changed**: ~1500+ lines across 22 files

### 🎯 Validation
