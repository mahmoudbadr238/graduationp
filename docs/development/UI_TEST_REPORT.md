## Critical Issues Found & Fixed
1. 🔧 **System Snapshot Hardware Tab - GPU not visible**
   - **Cause:** StackLayout had fixed `preferredHeight: 720` which cut off second row
   - **Fix:** Changed to `Layout.minimumHeight: 800` to allow scrolling
   - **Status:** FIXED ✅

2. 🔧 **AnimatedCard hover causing layout jump**
   - **Cause:** `y: hoverLift` property shifting cards up by -3px
   - **Fix:** Set `y: 0` permanently, reduced scale to 1.005
   - **Status:** FIXED ✅

3. 🔧 **Pages disappearing after 0.5s on hover**
   - **Cause:** StackView transitions animating opacity conflicting with page opacity
   - **Fix:** Removed opacity animations from transitions, kept only x slide
   - **Status:** FIXED ✅

---

## Minor Enhancements Recommended (Future)
1. ⚠️ Convert Scan Tool tiles to AnimatedCard for consistency
2. ⚠️ Convert DLP metrics to LiveMetricTile for pulsing effect
3. ⚠️ Add row hover effect to Scan History table
4. ⚠️ Add actual settings controls in Settings page sections
5. ⚠️ Implement keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys)
6. ⚠️ Add tooltips for icon-only elements
7. ⚠️ Add loading states for Loaders in System Snapshot tabs
