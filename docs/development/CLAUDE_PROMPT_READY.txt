YOUR MISSION:
1. Read MASTER_FIX_GUIDE.md completely first
2. Implement ALL 20 fixes (backend + frontend)
3. Integrate ALL 3 AI models:
   - AI Model #1: Event Viewer Simplifier
   - AI Model #2: DLP Threat Analyzer
   - AI Model #3: Security Chatbot
4. Run full test suite - 100% pass rate required
5. Create production-ready build

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES (In this order):

PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (15 hours)
- Fix Unicode encoding in events_windows.py
- Add timeouts to startup_orchestrator.py
- Fix GPU subprocess hanging in gpu_backend.py
- Optimize database in sqlite_repo.py

## WHICH PROMPT TO USE

**Choose one:**

- ✅ **Use the BIG PROMPT** if Claude is reliable and you want fast completion
