## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Sentinel Won't Start

**Symptom:** Double-click `main.py`, nothing happens.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Python installed:**
   - Open PowerShell
   - Type `python --version`
   - Should show Python 3.10 or newer
   - **If not:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install missing packages:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Sentinel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check error message:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   # Read the error message and Google it
   ```

---

### Problem: "Not Running as Administrator" Warning

**Symptom:** Orange badge says "Not Admin" on Dashboard.

**Impact:**
- Event Viewer can't read Security logs
- Some network scans might fail

**Solution:**
- Right-click `scripts/run_as_admin.bat` → Run as Administrator
- **OR** Right-click `main.py` in root folder → Run as Administrator

**Why:** Windows protects sensitive logs from normal users.

---

### Problem: Live Charts Show 0%

**Symptom:** CPU/Memory/GPU charts are flat at 0%.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait 5 seconds:** Charts update every 1 second, might still be loading.
2. **Check psutil installed:**
   ```powershell
   pip show psutil
   # Should show version 6.1.0 or newer
   ```
3. **Restart Sentinel:** Close completely, reopen.

---

### Problem: AI Explanations Not Working

**Symptom:** No AI explanations appearing for events.

**Solution:**
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Copy key from your dashboard
3. Create `.env` file in Sentinel folder (no name, just `.env`)
4. Add line: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`
5. Save file
6. Restart Sentinel
7. AI explanations should now work ✅

**Note:** File must be named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)

---

### Problem: Network Scan Takes Forever

**Symptom:** Scan running for 10+ minutes, no results.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check target:** `192.168.1.0/24` (not `192.168.1.0/16` which scans 65,000 IPs!)
2. **Use Safe Scan:** Deep Scan can take 15+ minutes for large networks
3. **Check firewall:** Might be blocking Nmap (temporarily disable for scan)
4. **Verify Nmap installed:** Dashboard badge should be green

---

### Problem: High CPU Usage (Sentinel Using 10%+)

**Symptom:** Task Manager shows `python.exe` using lots of CPU.

**Normal usage:**
- Idle: 1-2% CPU
- During scan: 5-10% CPU
- Live charts updating: 3-5% CPU

**Solutions:**
1. **Close other Python programs:** Might be conflicting
2. **Restart Sentinel:** Memory leak? (rare, but possible)
3. **Check for infinite loops:** If persists, report bug on GitHub

---

### Problem: Scan History Shows "0 scans loaded"

**Symptom:** Scan History page is empty, even though you've run scans.

**Explanation:** This is actually correct behavior on first install!
- Scans only save when using Scan Tool page
- Quick Scan button on Home doesn't save to history (it's a quick check)

**How to populate:**
1. Go to Scan Tool (Ctrl+6)
2. Run any scan type (Quick/Full/Deep)
3. Wait for completion
4. Go to Scan History (Ctrl+4)
5. Should now show 1 scan

---
