## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **CSV Export Backend**: Export CSV button shows toast notification but actual file export requires backend implementation (planned for v1.1)

2. **Settings Placeholders**: General Settings and Scan Preferences sections are placeholders awaiting content (Phase 2)

3. **ComboBox Styling**: Theme selector uses default Qt ComboBox styling (platform-dependent dropdown appearance)

4. **Admin Privileges**: Some security features require administrator privileges (warning shown on startup)
